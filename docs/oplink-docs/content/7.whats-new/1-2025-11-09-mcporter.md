description: Better docs for mcporter integration and authentication patterns
---

- Added a deep dive on how Oplink relies on mcporter for transport, discovery, and auth handoffs (stdio+HTTP)
- Published an authentication guide covering API key placeholders, HTTP headers, and OAuth flows (Linear demo)
- Cleaned the Linear + Discord example to use `npx @chinchillaenterprises/mcp-discord` and placeholder env files
- Introduced `test:ci` (non-interactive) scripts plus new registry tests for env expansion
