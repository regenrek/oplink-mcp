# OPLINK Release Process

1. **Version Bump**
   Choose a new version following [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/):
   ```bash
   npm version patch
   ```
   or `minor` or `major` as appropriate.

2. **Build & Test**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm test
   ```

3. **Publish**
   Publish to npm:
   ```bash
   npm publish
   ```
   For alpha or beta releases:
   ```bash
   npm publish --tag alpha
   ```

4. **Tag & Release Notes**
   - Push git tags to GitHub
   - Draft release notes detailing changes

After publishing, confirm that `npx oplink@latest` pulls the correct version. Thank you for helping ensure OPLINK remains robust and up-to-date.
