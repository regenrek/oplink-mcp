Welcome to **OPLINK**, a powerful workflow orchestration tool for modern software development. As software engineers, we understand the challenges of managing complex development workflows and the need for better tooling. That's why we created OPLINK - to revolutionize how developers interact with AI and tools in their code editor.

Model Context Protocol (MCP) gives us unprecedented access to tools and the ability to combine everything directly in the code editor. However, managing multiple MCP servers, prompts, and workflows can be challenging. OPLINK solves this by providing a unified way to orchestrate and share these powerful capabilities.

## Why OPLINK?

OPLINK was born from our experience as software engineers, recognizing that workflows are everywhere in software development - from testing and debugging to code reviews and stack building. We saw an opportunity to make these workflows more efficient and accessible through the power of AI and MCP tools.

By providing a structured way to organize and share these workflows, OPLINK helps teams:

- Standardize development practices
- Reduce cognitive load when switching between tasks
- Make AI tools more accessible and practical
- Improve collaboration and knowledge sharing
- Accelerate development cycles

Whether you're a solo developer or part of a large team, OPLINK helps you harness the full potential of AI-powered development tools in your daily workflow.
