## What are OPLINK Workflows?

OPLINK workflows are the building blocks of software development, allowing you to organize and orchestrate multiple prompts and tools. Think of workflows as a dynamic prompting library that you can easily share and version control through YAML files.

## Why Use Workflows?

The key to effective AI assistance is knowing when and how to use the right tools. Workflows help make this process easier by:

* ✅ Combining prompts with MCP servers into reusable workflows
* ✅ Triggering workflows with custom commands like "enter debugger mode"
* ✅ Defining strategies for how to use multiple tools (sequential or situational)
* ✅ Easily onboarding your team to the best prompts with version control

## How Workflows are Organized

In OPLINK, workflows are typically stored within the `.mcp-workflows` folder, with each file representing a specific configuration or "mode" of operation. Some examples:

- **coding.yaml** — Defines prompts for debugging, architecture, or refactoring steps
- **thinking.yaml** — Contains reflective or brainstorming prompts
- **github.yaml** — Sets up prompts for reviewing pull requests, creating branches, or saving changes

## Workflow Structure

Each `.yaml` file can contain multiple named sections with `description` and `prompt`, and optionally typed `parameters`:

```yaml
my_mode:
  description: "Custom reflection mode"
  prompt: |
    You are in custom reflection mode. We'll systematically gather requirements and weigh tradeoffs...
  parameters:
    question:
      type: "string"
      required: true
```

## Tool Configuration Styles

You can define tools in several ways:

### Situational Tools (Default)

Tools that can be used as needed:

```yaml
web_debugger_mode:
  description: Debug my web application with browser logs
  prompt: |
    Reflect on why this isn't working. Theorize different possible sources of the problem.
  tools: getConsoleLogs, getConsoleErrors, getNetworkLogs, getNetworkErrors, takeScreenshot
```

### Sequential Tools

Tools that should be executed in a specific order:

```yaml
web_debugger_mode:
  description: Debug my web application with browser logs
  prompt: |
    Reflect on why this isn't working. Theorize different possible sources of the problem.
  toolMode: sequential
  tools: getConsoleLogs, getConsoleErrors, getNetworkLogs, getNetworkErrors, takeScreenshot
```

## Using Parameters

A powerful feature is the ability to inject parameters into your prompts:

```yaml
custom_mode:
  description: "Workflow with parameter injection"
  parameters:
    thought:
      type: "string"
      description: "A thought to reflect upon"
      required: true
  prompt: |
    Deeply reflect upon the provided thought: {{ thought }}
```

Parameters are automatically validated based on their type definitions and injected into your prompts at runtime.
