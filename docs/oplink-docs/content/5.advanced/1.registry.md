# OPLINK Registry (Advanced)

OPLINK can pull workflows from remote sources (e.g., GitHub, custom registries) via [Giget](https://github.com/unjs/giget) or other fetching strategies.

## Steps to Host Your Own
1. **Create a public or private Git repository** containing one or more `.yaml` workflow files.
2. **Reference** them in your local project:
   ```bash
   npx oplink add github:myorg/myrepo/workflows/coding
   ```
3. **Versioning**:
   - You can tag or branch to maintain multiple versions of the same workflow.
   - For example: `github:myorg/myrepo/workflows/coding#v2.0`.

## Sharing Workflows
- If your org uses a shared preset library, each project can pull updates from a single source.
- Combine this with `--force` or version tags to keep your .mcp-workflows in sync.

By leveraging OPLINK as a registry, you ensure consistent AI processes across multiple teams, repositories, or environments.
