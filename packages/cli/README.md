# Workflows MCP v0.1.0

Built by [@tedx_ai](https://x.com/tedx_ai)

Workflows MCP is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that allows you to orchestrate / combine many prompts + MCP servers into compound MCP prompting tools.

Think of it like a dynamic prompting library that you can easily share and version control through yaml files that also lets your define how to best use many MCP tools across many MCP servers for specific tasks.

## Overview

The key to effective MCP use is to know when/how to use the right tools. Workflows MCP helps make this process MUCH easier and faster. With Workflows MCP, you can:

✅ Combine prompts with MCP servers into reusable & easy to edit/share/organize workflows

✅ Trigger workflows with custom commands like: "enter debugger mode" or "use thinking mode"

✅ Define custom strategies for how to use many tools in a workflow (sequential or situational/dynamic)

✅ Easily onboard your team to the best prompts + ways to use many MCP tools w/ version control.

_We also provide a number of useful presets to get you started 🫡_

### So why use this?

The goal of this project is to turn prompts into programmable tools and rules for AI in a code editor more deterministic while reducing the overall amount of token use across all requests. Since stuffing a global set of rules for AI can eat up your context window, using MCP to route to prompts and workflows can help reduce the overall amount of tokens used across all requests.

Workflows for MCP are also **incredibly** powerful! For instance, you can create an **"production incident workflow"** tool that has a special system prompt to reason about an incident in a particular way and then use a series of tools in a specific order to analyze + potentially resolve the incident. This may involve things like:

- Gathering logs across many MCP tools for Kubernetes, Cloudwatch, Splunk, etc
- Checking Github issues or a vector database for similar issues in the past
- Perform web searches for useful information on the web
- Analyze your code with all the gathered context from the prior steps
- Write a detailed incident report with all the context from the prior steps
- Gather input from you to better understand the problem space
- Implement a fix for issue if possible

And since these workflows are all defined in YAML and can be referenced from anywhere on your machine, you can **easily** rally your team around when/how to use the best prompts and sequences of MCP tools for specific tasks 🦾

## Features

### 📝 Custom Configuration

- Load custom configs from multiple YAML files in a `.workflows` or `.mcp-workflows` directory
- Easily save these yaml files to a git repo and share with your team
- Since MCP servers can have custom configs for each project, you can easily pick and choose which configs to use for each project - setting up custom workflow folders for each project
- Support for typed parameter inputs in tool configurations makes building custom MCP prompting tools a breeze

## Installation

Install the MCP server into an MCP client using the following command or JSON:

```bash
npx -y @agentdesk/workflows-mcp@latest
```

If using JSON in Cursor to setup your MCP server, you can use the following config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workflows-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@agentdesk/workflows-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

To provide custom configurations, you can use the `--config` flag to point to a directory containing YAML configuration files. The directory must be named `.workflows` or `.mcp-workflows` as so:

```bash
npx @agentdesk/workflows-mcp@latest --config /path/to/.workflows
```

If you want to enable presets, you can use the `--preset` flag to specify which presets to load:

```bash
npx @agentdesk/workflows-mcp@latest --preset thinking,coding,github
```

Here's what this would look like in a Cursor config all combined:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "workflows-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@agentdesk/workflows-mcp@latest --config /path/to/.workflows --preset thinking,coding"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Note:

- _If you update your config, you must refresh the MCP tool_
- _If refreshing doesn't work, make sure your config is valid YAML_
- _If you're still having issues, then try removing & renaming the MCP tool in your client_
- _If no config or preset is provided, it will default to using the `thinking` preset._
- _If you're still not able to get this working, open an issue ticket_

## Custom Workflow Configs

Create a `.workflows` or `.mcp-workflows` directory in your project and add YAML configuration files with any name (must end with `.yaml` or `.yml`). These configurations will also override the preset defaults if named the same as a preset tool.

### Example Configuration Files

#### Basic Workflow Configuration

```yaml
workflow_name:
  description: "Description of what this workflow does"
  prompt: |
    Enter your multi-line
    prompt here like this
  toolMode: "situational" # can be omitted as it's the default
  tools: "analyzeLogs, generateReport, validateFindings"
```

#### Tools Configuration Styles

You can define tools in several ways.

Here's an example of a tool that debugs a problem in a codebase with tools used situationally / as needed:

```yaml
web_debugger_mode:
  description: Debug my codebase my web application with browser logs and BrowserTools MCP
  prompt: |
    Deeply reflect upon all of this and think about why this isn't working. Theorize 4-6 different possible sources of the problem.

    Then, deeply reason about the root cause and distill your theories down to the 1-2 most probable sources of the problem before suggesting next steps.
  tools: getConsoleLogs, getConsoleErrors, getNetworkLogs, getNetworkErrors, takeScreenshot
```

This will return the following MCP response:

```
Deeply reflect upon all of this and think about why this isn't working. Theorize 4-6 different possible sources of the problem.


## Available Tools
Use these tools as needed to complete the user's request:

- getConsoleLogs
- getConsoleErrors
- getNetworkLogs
- getNetworkErrors
- takeScreenshot

After using each tool, return a 'Next Steps' section with a list of the next steps to take / remaining tools to invoke along with each tool's prompt/description and 'optional' flag if present.
```

#### Parameter Injection

A powerful feature is the ability to inject parameters into your prompts using the `{{ parameter_name }}` syntax:

```yaml
custom_mode:
  description: "Workflow with parameter injection"
  parameters:
    thought:
      type: "string"
      description: "A thought to deeply reflect upon"
      required: true
    idea:
      type: "string"
      description: "An additional idea to consider"
  prompt: |
    Deeply reflect upon the provided thought.
    Here's the thought: {{ thought }}

    Additional idea to consider: {{ idea }}

    Reflect upon the implications/tradeoffs it may have as it relates to my current goals.
```

Parameters are automatically validated based on their type definitions and injected into your prompts at runtime.

#### Sequential Tool Configuration

In sequential mode, tools are executed in a specific order:

```yaml
web_debugger_mode:
  description: Debug my codebase my web application with browser logs and BrowserTools MCP
  prompt: |
    Deeply reflect upon all of this and think about why this isn't working. Theorize 4-6 different possible sources of the problem.
  toolMode: sequential
  tools: getConsoleLogs, getConsoleErrors, getNetworkLogs, getNetworkErrors, takeScreenshot
```

This will return the following MCP response:

```
Deeply reflect upon all of this and think about why this isn't working. Theorize 4-6 different possible sources of the problem.

## Available Tools
If all required user input/feedback is acquired or if no input/feedback is needed, execute this exact sequence of tools to complete this task:

1. getConsoleLogs
2. getConsoleErrors
3. getNetworkLogs
4. getNetworkErrors
5. takeScreenshot

After using each tool, return a 'Next Steps' section with a list of the next steps to take / remaining tools to invoke along with each tool's prompt/description and 'optional' flag if present.
```

### Advanced Tool Configuration

Includes ability to define prompts for each tool and an optional flag to indicate if the tool is optional or not in the sequence:

```yaml
deep_thinking_mode:
  description: Reflect on a thought and produce a reflection/new set of thoughts
  parameters:
    thought:
      type: string
      description: A thought to deeply reflect upon
      required: true
  prompt: |
    Deeply reflect upon the provided thought.
    Reflect upon the implications/tradeoffs it may have as it relates to my current goals, challenges and our conversation.
    Do not change anything in our system, just return some thoughts/considerations/analysis based on your reflection of the provided thought.
  toolMode: "sequential"
  tools:
    analyze_thought: analyze a previously generated thought
    explore_perspectives: think about additional perspectives given the analysis
    apply_findings:
      propmt: implement the findings of the analysis
      optional: true
```

### Configuration Structure

Each YAML file should contain a mapping of tool names to their configuration. Configurations can be loaded from two sources:

1. Internal presets (located in the `presets` directory)
2. User-defined configurations (in `.workflows` or `.mcp-workflows` directory)

### Basic Tool Configuration

For each tool, you can specify:

- `name`: Optional name override for the registered tool (default is the config key)
- `description`: Description of what the workflow/tool does
- `prompt`: Custom prompt (completely replaces default prompt if workflow name is also an active preset)
- `context`: Additional context to append to the prompt (does not replace default prompt for presets)
- `tools`: Array or object of tools available in this mode, with flexible definition styles
- `toolMode`: Mode of tool execution, either "sequential" or "situational" (defaults to "situational")
- `parameters`: Object mapping of parameters as input to the tool - supports template injection using {{ parameter_name }}
- `disabled`: Boolean to disable the tool

### Input Parameter Configuration

Tools can accept typed parameters that an MCP Client / agent can provide to improve reasoning capabilities for your prompt/workflow. These inputs are automatically converted to Zod schemas for validation and type safety. Each parameter is defined with the following properties:

| Property      | Description                                                            | Required                 |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `type`        | Data type: "string", "number", "boolean", "array", "object", or "enum" | Yes                      |
| `description` | Human-readable description of the parameter                            | No                       |
| `required`    | Whether the parameter is required                                      | No (defaults to `false`) |
| `default`     | Default value if not provided                                          | No                       |
| `enum`        | Array of valid values (required for `enum` type only)                  | Yes (for `enum` type)    |
| `items`       | For array types, defines the type of items in the array                | No                       |
| `properties`  | For object types, defines the properties of the object                 | No                       |

#### Example Input Parameter Types

```yaml
# String parameter
name:
  type: "string"
  description: "User's name"
  required: true

# Number parameter with default
limit:
  type: "number"
  description: "Maximum items to return"
  default: 10

# Boolean parameter with default
includeArchived:
  type: "boolean"
  description: "Include archived items"
  default: false

# Enum parameter with predefined options
sortOrder:
  type: "enum"
  enum: ["asc", "desc"]
  description: "Sort direction"
  default: "asc"

# Array parameter with item type
tags:
  type: "array"
  description: "List of tags to filter by"
  items:
    type: "string"
    description: "A tag value"

# Object parameter with nested properties
filters:
  type: "object"
  description: "Complex filter object"
  properties:
    status:
      type: "enum"
      enum: ["active", "inactive", "pending"]
      description: "Status filter"
    dateRange:
      type: "object"
      properties:
        start:
          type: "string"
          description: "Start date"
        end:
          type: "string"
          description: "End date"
```

### Configuration Loading

The system loads configurations in the following order:

1. Internal presets from the `presets` directory
2. User-defined configurations from `.workflows` or `.mcp-workflows` directory
3. Merges configurations, with user-defined settings taking precedence

When merging configurations:

- Tool arrays are concatenated rather than replaced
- Other properties are overridden by the user-defined configuration
- Parameters are merged with user-defined parameters taking precedence

## How It Works

Workflows MCP operates through a sophisticated configuration and tool registration system:

1. **Configuration Loading and Merging**

   - Loads preset configurations from internal YAML files in the `presets` directory
   - Optionally loads user-defined configurations from `.workflows` or `.mcp-workflows` directories
   - Merges configurations with user configs taking precedence over presets
   - Supports both sequential and situational tool execution modes

2. **Tool Registration and Validation**

   - Each tool is dynamically registered with the MCP server based on the merged configuration
   - Tools can be customized with:
     - Custom names and descriptions
     - Typed parameters with validation
     - Custom prompts or extensions of preset prompts
     - Sequential or situational execution strategies
   - Validates tool configurations and parameters at registration time

3. **Parameter Handling**

   - Parameters are defined using a type-safe configuration system
   - Supports multiple parameter types: string, number, boolean, array, object, and enum
   - Automatically converts parameter definitions to Zod schemas for runtime validation
   - Provides automatic validation of parameter values during tool execution

4. **Prompt Management**

   - Manages prompts through a flexible system that supports:
     - Default prompts from presets
     - Custom user-defined prompts
     - Additional context injection
     - Dynamic tool availability based on mode
   - Supports both static and dynamic prompt generation based on configuration

5. **Error Handling and Debugging**
   - Comprehensive error handling during configuration loading and tool execution
   - Detailed logging for debugging and troubleshooting
   - Graceful fallbacks when configurations or tools are missing
   - Runtime validation of tool inputs and configurations

This architecture allows for powerful, type-safe interactions between tools and clients while maintaining flexibility through configuration-driven customization.
